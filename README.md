## Hi there 👋

I’m Revathi, a final-year engineering student who enjoys turning ideas into working projects.
I care more about logic, problem-solving, and purpose than flashy code.

I’m currently exploring AI, computer vision and neural networks and slowly shaping my profile one project at a time.

Pinned Projects:

Vision-Based Driver Drowsiness Detection – detects drowsy, distracted, and active states using vision techniques
Virtual Navigation Tour – interactive navigation experience for virtual environments
Neural Network Music Genre Prediction – predicts genre and redirects users to the song on YouTube (idea-driven project)
Portfolio Website – simple for now, improving it step by step for recruiters

I believe a strong idea + clear logic matters as much as code, and I’m continuously learning to bridge both.

Fun-facts:
I like making crafts
I like playing with toys even now
I like watching suspense/thriller films
